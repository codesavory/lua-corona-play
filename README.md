# lua-corona-play
Building a game using Corona Game Engine based on Lua, exploring the features of Lua to optimize game runtimes.

### Vision

For this project, we plan to work with the Lua language, which both of us are new to. We want to start off by exploring Luaâ€™s support for multiple paradigms. Following that, we also want to develop a simple 2D game in Lua using the Corona game engine. Using this game, we plan to study the runtime of the game engine in more detail, and possibly implement optimizations to the runtime for our game.

### Project Plan

**Week - 4**: Learn Lua syntax and setup

**Week - 5**: Learn different paradigms & Explore Corona SDK - 2D Game Engine

**Week - 6**: Putting together building blocks for the game

**Week - 7**: Extend game into the OOP paradigms

**Week - 8**: Explore runtime for game and perform code profiling

**Week - 9**: Presentations and Documentation

### Notes

Every week, we will track our progress in `progress.md` within the week's folder, and include relevant files there too.
